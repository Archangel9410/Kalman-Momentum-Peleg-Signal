    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "Our team created a strategy based on Kalman-filter momentum and an enhanced short-term reversal signal with lidquidty constraints. The strategy had a significant Sharpe ratio even out-of-sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our strategy contains two layers of sorting. For the first sort, we grouped firms by SIC2 and then calculated equally-weighted return of firms within each group. We then used a Kalman-filter to estimate each SIC2 return's the state mean $\\mu_{t-1}$ and variance $\\sigma_{t-1}^2$ at $t-1$. Using these estimates, we calculated risk-adjusted returns \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu_{t-1} - \\frac{1}{2}\\sigma_{t-1}^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and used this as our time $t$ investment signal. The second sort is based on the enhanced short-term reversal signal. Within this sort, the signal for longing or shorting firm $j$ is the one-month lagged spread between the returns of firm $j$'s fundamental group $r_{j, t-1}^{(f)}$ and the firm $r_{j, t-1}$. That is, investment in firm $j$ at time $t$ is based on the signal\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r_{j, t-1}^{(f)} - r_{j, t-1}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental return $r^{(f)}$ is calculated using similarity scores between pairs of firms. Remove pairs with a similarity score below 0.07. Of the remaining scores, remove firms whcih are similar to fewer than five other firms. For each firm $j$, its fundamental returns $r_j^{(f)}$ is the equally weighted returns of all firms which are still similar to $j$. \n",
    "\n",
    "There were two liquity constraints in our strategy. Remove any stock that has a rolling three-month average stock price that is less than $\\$10$, and any stock whose market equity is below the 10th percentile of lagged rolling three-month market equity. We imposed these contraints to remove firms with large trading costs as well as illiquid small capitalization firms. We rolling averages of data from time $t-3$ to time $t-1$ instead of simply using time $t-1$ data because we wanted to avoid removing observations due to sharp temporary declines.   \n"

    "# 2. Data Description\n",
    "Our return data were obtained from the CRSP database on the WRDS website, where we also obtained gkvey and SIC code data from the COMPUSTAT database. As for creating the fundamental groups, we used the similiarity scores from the Hoberg and Philips Data Library. The return data from CRSP ranges from Jan. 31st, 1972 to Dec. 31st, 2019, and the Hoberg data covers the time period from year 1988 to year 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divided the data into training and test sets to observe the out-of-sample performance of our strategy. The training set covers the period from Jan. 31st, 1972 to Dec. 31st, 2008, and the test set covers the period from Jan. 31st, 2001 to Dec. 31st, 2019. The test set contains some overlap with the training set because the window of our Kalman-filter algothrim was 73 months (6 years plus 1 month), and therefore required some observtions in the training set to obtain an investment signal for Jan. 2009."
